# Bakalárska práca

Unfortunately I didn't have enough time or desire to write a detailed readme guide. 

If anyone is really interested in this work, you can find a guide to the contents of the repository inside the practical part of my work.

Also, each python file has comments and docstrings describing what that particular part does

You can find the usage guide in the pdf file `bakalarka_sk_Vielkin_final.pdf`, `Príloha č. 1`, `Príloha č. 2` are pages 54, 55
